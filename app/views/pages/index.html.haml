%h1 Angular + Rails i18n Demo
%h4 This website contains a small demo showing how to add i18n support to a Rails + Angular application.
%p With Ruby on Rails, I got used to having a reliable and simple translation (i18n) system. I only needed to ensure that caching took it into account too, and everyone was happy.

%p While building an Angular app powered by a Rails backend, we encountered that we had at least several places with strings to be translated: static Angular-less HTML pages, Angular templates, Angular controllers and server API responses.

%p In this talk I'll present an approach to use the Rails i18n as a general source for translations, and sharing it with the Angular frontend.
